do not run rspec. some rspec tests were created out of generating 
models and controllers. instead run these tests


WARNING: BEFORE you run the tests make sure to run this command:
rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test --trace 
(this will seed the test.db,
allowing the sign in and sign out specs to work) 

Then you can test every Rspec test by typing these commands:

rspec spec/features/home_spec.rb
rspec spec/requests/disclaimers_spec.rb
rspec spec/features/signin_spec.rb
rspec spec/features/signout_spec.rb
rspec spec/features/signin_fail_spec.rb
